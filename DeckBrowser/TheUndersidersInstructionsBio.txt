The Undersiders were brought together by an anonymous villain through a combination of subtle pressure and bribery over a year before Skitter joined the gang. He offered them a monthly allowance contingent on them remaining together as a group as well as individual enticements for several members of the group.

They gained a reputation as robbery and escape specialists, performing corporate thefts for their employer such as robbing the Ruby Dreams casino. They were considered small-time, which was intentional on the part of their benefactor.

Some time before the events of Worm, they attracted the ire of Lung, likely due to them operating within his territory without consequence for quite some time. Once Skitter joined, the group gained power and notoriety quickly, as well as several new members. At their height, The Undersiders controlled most of Brockton Bay with little pushback.
